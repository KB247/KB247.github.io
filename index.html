    <p>This video plays with the themes of what it means to be a ‘living’ thing. Various household objects are set into motion, seemingly with a life of their own. Marbles chase each other like fish in a pond, pictures draw themselves, and loose change slides across the frame unaided. This is mixed with imagery of actual living plants to contrast in a dreamlike landscape.</p>
